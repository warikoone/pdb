I'm a Machine Learning enthuaist and budding scientist interested in questions like 'Concepts of Learning interpretability within ML black boxes' and 'how customized learning interpretability could help match machine learning to human comprehension'. 

Graduated recently with Doctoral Degree in Bio-Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning; I'm presently keeping working as a Research Intern @ Deutsche Boerse, Frankfurt.
